Hello, Iâ€™m Mohammad Pakdost, and I am proud to be a Khavaran Institute of Higher Education graduate in Computer Engineering from July 2018. My University is located in Mashhad, Iran. 

I have been a QA test engineer since 2020, but I decided to advance further in the computer Environment and become a skillful programmer. 

I'm so passionate about being a programmer. I wanted to do this long ago, but due to my financial situation, I had to work a full-time and a part-time job. 

To achieve my dream, I started to look for a path that led me to a bright future. As a result, I joined MCDA to move further through my academic path.

I'm an avid hiker, hitting the trails every two weeks. It's more than a hobby; it's my passion. These hikes connect me with nature's beauty.

From serene forests to rugged mountains, I explore diverse landscapes, savoring nature's sights, sounds, and scents.

Hiking tests my physical and mental limits, fostering self-discovery and growth. It's also a mental reset, offering solace from daily demands.

Sharing this passion with friends enhances the experience, creating lasting memories and connections.

In essence, biweekly hiking is my way of embracing nature, testing my limits, and finding peace outdoors. It's a cherished routine.

I have two more friends with whom we shaped a group about our common interest "hiking". Their names are Wang Wei and Nicolas Nghia Phan. 


 Nicolas is interested in hiking because he loves being closer to nature. Hiking makes him feel calmer and more resilient physically and mentally.

When he goes hiking, he always tries to explore different paths, paths that lead to the most secluded places, and paths that lead to the highest summits.


Sean (Wei Wang) is from Shanghai, China. He has been working in software development for many years. He created the group about "hiking" on WhatsApp.

He enjoys hiking trips and has done many of them mostly in China, and some in Vietnam and Taiwan. He is looking forward to exploring more of our blue planet.

So he thinks he will start this group for the topic 'hiking'. He wants to share his traveling stories and hear others.
